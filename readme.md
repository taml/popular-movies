Popular Movies App
===================================

This app displays a grid of movies which can be sorted by most popular
or highest rated. Each movie in the grid can be selected which opens
a detailed activity displaying the movie title, poster, synopsis, release 
date and a star rating. 


Getting Started
---------------

To build this project please use "Import Project" in Android Studio. 
Please also add your TMDB (The Movie Database) API key to 
`utilities > QueryUtils (String key)` so that the app can fetch movie
data from the API.
